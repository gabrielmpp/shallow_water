Please follow the instructions in the config and in the run_model.py main function.
The model and the plots are done when running the run_model.py
The plots for tasks E, F and G require the netcdfs to be available in the /outputs folder, so it is necessary to run the model with the desired configuration before these plots are produced. Please refer to the plotlib.py plot_task_F and plot_task_G for documentation about the required files.
